<h2 style="text-align:center"> The Experience of Loneliness While Living in Society: Mars in the Hospital </h2>

I remember in the hospital, my blood being drained from my body into a filtration device as I passed the hours watching movies. The Martian, directed by Ridley Scott, was the movie that stuck with me after all these years. For a long time, I felt distant from the world and the people in it. This could be a result of not communicating with the outside world. Moreover, having to trust others as well as myself filled me with anxiety. People think that The Martian is just another science fiction blockbuster made to entertain; however, I believe the real message is about the isolation people feel while trying to survive in society.

I believe Martian was one of the most important movies to come out in the 2010s. While being nominated by the Academy for best motion picture, writing, sound mixing, and best actor. I think that this recognition of talent is valid. Unfortunately, The Martian did not win a single Oscar.  I personally believe the Academy did not grasp the relevance of the picture. In my opinion, nothing is more relatable than being left to fend for your own on an alien planet; Confident that no one is going to save you. I feel like many people experience the same isolation and societal pressures that are present throughout The Martian.

The world has felt out of reach for a long period of my life. During the first few days in the hospital, I felt extremely out of touch with reality. I only saw my parents a few times before going into a spinal tap surgery. After that, I had a tube placed into the neck in order to pump out blood and replace my plasma. It felt like my old life was being taken away from me and a new one was being placed in. I think my parents felt similar to when The Director of Mars Operations Vincent Kapoor found out Mark Watney was still alive, he states, “He’s 50 million miles away from home. He thinks he’s totally alone, He thinks we gave up on him” (The Martian, 34:09-34:13). I embraced my abandonment of my old self and accepted the new environment. Both Mark and me, in spite of the situation, were able to keep a high spirits throughout this period of time. Mark took steps obtaining communication with The National Aeronautic and Space Administration (NASA), while I only thought about communicating with my peers because of the pressure of alienation.

Mark Watney was unable to communicate with the world, whereas I choose not to. During The Martian, Mark Watney found the Mars rover Pathfinder in an attempt to contact NASA. I cannot relate to this, because I spent most of my time worrying about myself; I did not want to involve my friends into my illness. I realize now that this lack of communication was a mistake. Furthermore, If I had been more open like Mark, I would have found a solution with the people around me instead of blocking them out. Mark was able to figure out a solution to his communication problems by locating the Mars Pathfinder. I think that if I had the same courageous attitude Mark displayed, I would have been much happier in the long term. I see now that trusting people is the best way to get out of an isolated situation and thrive in our communities.
	
Both Mark Watney and I had to have faith in the people around us as well as ourselves, even if we were scared. During the end of The Martian, Mark Watney was giving a lecture to future astronauts about how he survived on Mars alone for over 500 sols. He talked about how you can either give up or you can get to work. That is all is. Solving one problem at a time (The Martian, 2:13:15 - 2:14:20). In the hospital, I had a similar philosophy. I took each day one step at a time, trusting that the people around me would take care of me in my time of need. By trying to be more communicative and trusting, I believe that I made my recovery accelerate. Mark saved himself by believing in the people at NASA and I saved myself by believing in the nurses, doctors, friends and family who took care of me.  I believe that with this trust, I was able to conqueror my seclusive nature and live better in society.

Although The Martian was an extremely entertaining motion picture and box office success, its true value reveals by speaking to the solitude felt by everyone in the world. Ridley Scott, has created a timeless classic in my eyes with The Martian. Even though, I felt secluded from the culture for an extended period of time. I understand now that it was due to a lack of contact with the surrounding environment. Furthermore, I learned to entrust people around me, even if I was full of dread. I am finally able to get up from the filtration device and experience living in society.
