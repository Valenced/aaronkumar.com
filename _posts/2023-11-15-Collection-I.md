**History**

I always want to be a part of something big. I craved the idea that one day, I would look back and see my name in the history books. But my philosophy needs to be revised. Now more than ever, I realize you can only do so many things to become a crucial part of history. The question is, will I live to see the day? I don't know if I will; I'll probably die without ever knowing my potential because I lack the motivation. I've never been very driven; I have coasted through my hardships and made it out alive. Coasting does not show a sign of growth but rather a regression of my talents as a man. If I was more present, and a part of life, I would have more to offer in terms of history. 

**Going Nowhere**

When I'm on that treadmill and bike, I'm going nowhere. Ironically, I am going nowhere in my life as well. It feels like I'm trapped in limbo, forever running away from my own anxieties. 

I am riddled with anxiety, and yet people still think that I am fearless. But this is the furthest thing from the truth. I feel like I've put myself on a pedestal, and it hurts when I don't progress. I've been doing this shit for a long time, and I feel like a fraud almost because I gave up on my goals. Honestly, I'm disappointed in myself. And yet, I am happy because I realize my imperfections. 

I haven't been very healthy for the past 6 months and have been regressing in strength for a while now. I don't quite know why I suddenly stopped caring about my body or really anything in life, but I'm here to say you are not alone when you feel like shit. I'm going to make a promise to anyone reading this. That I will try, I cannot promise that my efforts will be good or bad, but I will try. That is more than I have done my entire life, and it may be the most significant promise I have ever made.

**Addiction**

What are you supposed to do if you're someone like me? I don't have a support system I feel comfortable falling back onto. I have my friends and family who are there for me, but I can't really speak to them about my personal issues. Usually, I don't feel comfortable telling anyone about these bad habits and the adverse effects they have on my mental health. Partially because I don't believe anyone cares or wants to know about these underlying problems. But mainly because I don't dare to tell anyone. Is it a lack of courage in me? Or is it a denial of acceptance? I don't know why I cannot conquer my addictions. It feels like the best I can ever hope to achieve is simply making my addictions into something healthy rather than ridding myself completely. But is any addiction genuinely beneficial? I guess the greats were addicted to life. But many great people I admire in history were addicted to power. This power is something I fear because I know in my heart that I will fall prey to it if I am not cautious. 

**Wealth**

No amount of money will change the fact that I'm lazy, arrogant, and depressed. I need to spark change within myself for the sake of myself. I will never reach my potential if I don't become the man I want to be. Ultimately, no amount of money will save the people around me. I can provide the inspiration and the ability to overcome and conquer. I can provide leadership, but first, I must lead myself. 

**Exodus**

Why does it have to end? Who is in charge of the ship? Lead us back to the lands and seas, for no soul wants to live in this desolation. Wishful thinking is all in my head. I thought I lost a great fort but instead a on-looks fasting ways. I saw a journey and took the road, but the play still needs to do its acts. I sought out a fury and received a jury of the past.
