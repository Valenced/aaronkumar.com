My name is Aaron, but you can probably infer that. I like to think of myself as a jack of all trades. I program as a hobby and write for fun. I never sat still as a kid. I was in search of something new. I was paralzyed at the age of 12 for my hubris. God probably thought, "Dang! that kid needs to slow down". At 18, I spent two years in a hibernative state pondering the simple question, "Is life worth it?". I finally realized that what I was looking for was not in the outside world but within me. Life has never been in my control; I do not try to fight the current. It is better to go with the flow of water. I see now that without some form of faith, I will never answer paradoxes of life. Welcome to the archive of my communicative and spirtual development.
