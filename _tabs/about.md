I like to think of myself as a jack of all trades. I program as a hobby and write for fun. I never sat still as a kid. Ironically, I was paralyzed at the age of 12. God probably thought, "Dang! That kid needs to slow down". At 18, I spent two years in a hibernative state pondering the simple question, "Is life worth it?". I finally realized that what I was looking for was not in the outside world but within me. Life has never been in my control; I do not try to fight the current. I see now that without some form of faith, I will never answer the paradoxes of life. This is an archive of my communicative and spiritual development.
